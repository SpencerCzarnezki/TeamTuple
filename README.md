# When Running
Homepage: 
While not logged in, a visitor to the website has the access to search for events,
register as a user, and login to the site.
When logged in as a user, the user has access to the search page, my events page, and add event page. A button
for logging out will appear where the register and login buttons were.
When logged in as an admin, the admin has an extra page called admin events.

Register page:
This page allows for someone to register as a user on the website. The user enters their first and last names,
username, email address, and password to be confirmed. All passwords must be at least _ characters long,
have a number and special character to be valid. Selecting save when a required field is not entered will 
prompt the user to fill in the field and if there is an invalid password or filled username, 
the visitor will be notified to change it.

Login Page:
If a visitor has already registered as a user, they may enter their username and password here to log in.
Invalid login data will prompt the user to re-enter the proper data.
